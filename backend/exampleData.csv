Number of women to lose their unborn child after having the Covid Vaccine increases by 366% in just six weeks,"Losing a new born is a heart breaking endeavour, as in the pain of losing an unborn child. Which is why we're both saddened and shocked to bring you the latest update on the number of unborn and newborn children to lose their lives as a result of the mothers receiving one of the Covid-19 vaccines in the United Kingdom.

The Government have released weekly reports on adverse reactions to the experimental Covid-19 vaccines, the first of which covered data inputted to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme from the 9th December 2020 through to the 24th January 2021. Their latest report, which is the seventh to be released covers data inputted to the MHRA Yellow Card scheme from the 9th December 2020 though to the 7th March 2021. 

Just six weeks separate the first and seventh report, and the shocking increase in the number of women losing their unborn and newborn child in that time due to having either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca Covid vaccine is appalling.

This was the Governments own advice upon emergency approval of the Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine –

There are no limited amount of data from the use of COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2.

Animal reproductive toxicity studies have not been completed. COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is not recommended during pregnancy.

For women of childbearing age, pregnancy should be excluded before vaccination. In addition, women of childbearing age should be advised to avoid pregnancy for at least 2 months after their second dose.

We told you about this back in December, as the Governments own advice also included comments on breast-feeding and fertility which were as follows - 

It is unknown whether COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 is excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 should not be used during breast-feeding.

It is unknown whether COVID-19 mRNA Vaccine BNT162b2 has on fertility.

It is because of this advice released by the UK Government that we were so shocked to see in the first released report of adverse reactions to the Covid vaccines, using data inputted to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme up to the 24th January 2021 a total of 4 women had suffered a miscarriage as a result of having the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.

According to the seventh report released by the UK GOvernment on adverse reactions to the Covid vaccines, using data inputted to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme up to the 7th March 2021, there has been a 475% increase since the 24th January in the number of women who have lost their unborn child after having the Pfizer vaccine, bringing the total to 23. This is devastating.

Sadly there is also now 1 report of a premature baby sadly dying after the mother had the Pfizer vaccine.

Tragically there has also been 1 still birth reported to the MHRA Yellow Card Scheme after the mother had the AstraZeneca vaccine, but shockingly this has not been labelled as a fatality.

The question is why are we seeing these numbers when the Governments own advice was that pregnant women should not have the vaccine?",easy,https://dailyexpose.co.uk/2021/03/21/miscarriages-after-having-covid-vaccine-increases-by-366-percent/ ,TRUE,"This is fake news.

S'poreans to rid country of old people instead of raising GST to 9%,"Singaporeans from all walks of life, who have their priorities right, have voted in a referendum to rid the country of all old people instead of raising the GST to 9 percent to fund their future needs.

But after careful deliberation, Singaporeans voted in favour of no old people left in the country. 

One Singaporean, Gan Diao Tah, said: ""Singapore is always faced with hard choices and forks in the road.""

""So, now we must make another hard choice. Do we want to make the current generation pay for the future spending by increasing the GST to 9 percent? Or do we want to get rid of old people now so that we don't make the young pay more?""

"CLEVER GORILLA LEARNS HOW TO KNIT 
THE RESOURCEFUL PRIMATE WAS FOUND KNITTING HERSELF A SCARF","Gorillas are known to be pretty smart primates, but who would have thought they are capable of knitting? Although not the product of some science experiment, Penny the gorilla, from the National Zoo, managed to pull a pretty swell surprise on her caretakers. 

The whole thing happened purely by accident. Someone with a passion for knitting forgot their yarn and needles in the gorilla’s habitat. Penny, who thought the items looked pretty funny, fiddled with them around. Next thing, she was casting on her stitches and starting to make herself a scarf. 

Just how intelligent gorillas really are? This is a question for scientists and one that may have found a small step for solving in this minor incident. No matter what motivated Penny to knit half a scarf, it is obvious she proved gorillas are much more than what can be seen with the naked eye. 

Knitting is a centuries old human occupation and it involves dexterity, problem solving and creativity. Apparently, Penny the gorilla lacks none of the above, as she even managed to swap between colors. 

Hilarious responses to the story were inevitable. The news broke on Facebook and Twitter, and many people were engrossed with it. After all, it is not every day that a gorilla takes on knitting just like that.

Monkeys are known to be great at imitating human behavior, a proof that we are not that far from our closest relatives in the food chain. 

Now all that is left for Penny to do is to start knitting for the entire zoo. All the animals could use a bit of extra warmth and the handy and crafty Penny will not hesitate to help each one of them with a small knitted creation.

U.S. Airlines May Start Weighing Passengers At The Gate,"U.S. airlines may need to start weighing passengers in order to comply with FAA rules. For safety reasons, carriers need to calculate an aircraft’s weight and balance, and it has to be within allowable limits for the plane. However the assumptions they’ve been using for passengers are outdated. Americans are getting fatter, and the federal government wants airlines to find out how much fatter their passengers have gotten, at least for smaller aircraft. 

• The FAA realizes that passenger weight can vary by route and airlines may want to document this difference. 
• Standard weights may not be appropriate for smaller planes, with smaller sample size and greater likelihood of variance from average. 

Airlines can use standard weights published by the CDC for larger aircraft, with variance for winter and summer based on greater weight assumptions for clothing in the winter. However they outline a method for smaller aircraft to determine “[a]ctual passenger and bag weights” and to determine whether aircraft up to 70 seats should be considered small or large for this exercise. 

Airlines also have to calculate average weights for crewmembers and crew bags, too. 

How Some Airlines May Weigh Passengers 

Air Insight reviews the details of new documentation requirements for aircraft weight and balance contained in ‘Advisory Circular 120-27F’ that are pending. The FAA took public comment on their draft guidance last spring, and we’re reaching the point where final FAA action should take place. 

The FAA says that surveys should be done at airports representing at least 15% of an airline’s daily departures in the secure area of the airport (to ensure that connecting passengers are included) and should select passengers at random. This is voluntary and passengers have to be allowed to opt out, with airlines then selecting another passenger at random and not the person who is next in line. 

Not only might we start seeing this soon, but it could become a regular occurrence, since “the FAA recommends operators accomplish such a review every 36 calendar-months.” Fortunately when airlines stick scales at boarding gates for this, the FAA notes, the scale’s “readout should remain hidden from public view” to protect passenger privacy. 

Some airlines, by the way, might not do this as a statistically valid survey every three years – carriers have the option of marking down the actual weights of each passenger on every flight, either by weighing everyone or just asking their weights and then having gate agents guess if a passenger is lying. 

Airlines All Over The World Weigh Passengers Already 

While it’s foreign to the U.S., weighing passengers isn’t all that uncommon abroad. Air New Zealand just went through a passenger weighing exercise similar to what U.S. carriers are going to have to do. 

Samoa Air reportedly charged passengers based on their weight, like the unmemorable chain restaurant I went to as a kid which ran a promotion charging children by their weight for meals. And in 2015 Uzbekistan Airways announced they would require all passengers to weigh in prior to boarding for safety even though airlines the world over maintain excellent safety records without the practice. 

I’ve even had to get on the scale myself. When I first flew Maldivian from Male on my first visit to the Maldives in 2012 I had to get on the scale at check-in. So did my wife, and – it appeared – every other foreigner. Maldivians did not seem to be asked to weigh in. 

On subsequent trips each year since the practice appeared to be abandoned. I was never asked to weigh in again, although Maldivian’s website says that the policy is still in place. 

Will New Weight Data Mean More Legroom For Passengers? 

Some consumer advocates have wanted minimum standards for legroom on planes. That would never do anything to hurt American, United or Delta. Instead it would potentially outlaw the tight seating you’ll find on Spirit Airlines or Frontier. And as a result it would undercut the pricing pressure they place on American, United, and Delta. In other words, we’d wind up with the same seats on the major airlines we have today – along with higher prices. 

However government weight rules could wind up affecting how many passengers the major airlines can place on board aircraft. Depending on the outcome of this study, American Airlines might no longer be permitted to stick 172 passengers on its Boeing 737s. 

Each passenger weighing more might mean being allowed to carry fewer passengers – if not now, then if passengers on average gain weight in subsequent weigh-in exercises. And as a result of being allowed to carry fewer passengers, they might as well either give back some of the distance between seats (in economy or first), or make more seats extra legroom Main Cabin Extra. 
None of this would be happening for passenger comfort. So even in the extreme, where airlines had to change their seating capacity, it would mean more legroom (fewer passengers) and not more seat width even though it is passenger girths that have changed. 

Since airlines will be lobbying vociferously against changes that would affect seating capacity, and they have allies in Congress like House Transportation Committee Chairman Pete DeFazio (D-Airlines For America), I’m not betting that the FAA will make changes that require removing seats from aircraft no matter what the data says.",hard,https://viewfromthewing.com/u-s-airlines-may-start-weighing-passengers-at-the-gate/,FALSE,"This is real news. As obesity rates continue to rise over the years, the Federal Aviation Administration noted that there was a higher risk of error between passengers' actual weight and the averages. Hence, weighing is in place to ensure that aircrafts maintain a safe weight in the sky and ensure efficiency of fuel and power.

Reports: Oklahoma woman shocked by lightning through laptop,"Officials said the lightning struck the woman's home, traveled through the electrical current, through power cords to her laptop, while she taught an online class. 

WASHINGTON — A woman was shocked, literally, when a storm blew through her town of Guthrie, Oklahoma, according to reports.

WBAL claimed that two bolts of lightning hit a couple's home and shocked a woman through her laptop, which she was using to teach an online class. After the incident, the couple found holes in their roof and their back deck caught on fire. However, firefighters were on the scene quickly to help. 

“The homeowner was inside working on teaching an online class via her laptop computer and was subsequently shocked while typing on that computer when the lightning hit,” Eric Harlow, Guthrie Fire Department Chief, told KFOR. “She was very, very minorly injured. Refused any treatment at the scene but as you can imagine was pretty scared and shook up.” 

Harlow told KFOR that the lightning strike traveled through the home's electrical current, through the power cords and the house causing the woman to be shocked. 

The National Weather Service claims that there are three main ways lightning can enter a structure, either by a direct strike, through wires or pipes that extend outside the structure or through the ground. It's recommended that during a lightning storm individuals stay off corded phones and electrical equipment like computers or TVs. 

The National Weather Service also said it isn't uncommon for lightning to strike in the same place twice. It said that lightning ""often strikes the same place repeatedly, especially if it's a tall, pointy, isolated object.""

"‘They taste just like ice cream’: People cannot get enough of blue Java bananas; have you tried them? 
Grown mostly in Southeast Asia and Hawaii, these blue-coloured bananas are known to taste like vanilla ice-cream","Bananas are popular world-over for being extremely nutritious. But, we are not talking about yellow bananas; a new variety of bananas is being talked-about these days. Called the Blue Java Bananas, they have a bluish tint and are said to have a creamy texture. But it is not only their unique colour and texture, the bananas — according to some people — taste like vanilla! For many, these even make an amazing choice for desserts. 

However, these bananas are quite rare and are not found everywhere. They are primarily grown in the Southeast Asian region but are also quite well-known in Hawaii. These fruits are a hybrid of two other kinds of bananas, namely Musa balbisiana and Musa acuminata. Interestingly enough, these bananas are cold tolerant and can grow even at temperatures below freezing point. But the ideal temperature for their growth is 40F. 

When these bananas are ripe, they generally have a pale yellow colour.

"The Moon is going to get its own 4G network, thanks to this rugged lunar rover","Nokia has been tasked by NASA to establish a reliable 4G network on the surface of the moon. One year ahead of launch, there is still much to plan for. 

From connecting offshore oil rigs and underground mines, to letting climbers livestream from 5,200 meters above sea level on Mount Everest: 4G networks are already capable of reaching some of the most remote spots on the planet. Now, the technology is gearing up for its next, extra-terrestrial challenge – to connect the Moon. 

NASA is planning to establish a sustainable human presence on the Moon by the end of the decade as part of its Artemis program, and with such a project inevitably comes a host of logistics issues. But although food, sleep or spacesuit design might be first to spring to mind, equally as important to life in outer space is appropriate communication.

This is why, with 4G networks – and the LTE technology that supports them – having already proven their resilience back on Earth, last year NASA turned to leading telecoms provider Nokia with an unusual request: to design a system that will establish a 4G network to be used by future moonwalking astronauts. 

The idea of internet-equipped space is not new. Astronauts on the International Space Station (ISS), for example, have been using Wi-Fi since 2008, and can now connect even their spacesuit to the network to stream video from space, communicate with other extraterrestrial vehicles or facilitate docking procedures. 
NASA has also developed proprietary software to enable communications between space and Earth, which requires an extensive network of antennas set up around the globe, as well as relay satellites, to forward data across billions of kilometers back to the ground. 

Nokia's option differs slightly, in that the company was tasked with setting up a local network on the Moon, which will only extend across roughly five kilometers, to enable communication between astronauts and equipment on the ground. 
""In their personal lives, astronauts have smartphones – so when they go into space, why would they not have access to the same capabilities for their communication and collaboration needs?"" Thierry Klein, head of the industrial automation research lab at Nokia Bell Labs, tells ZDNet. 

With space-equivalents of smartphones and devices connecting to a local moon-based 4G/LTE network, says Klein, astronauts would benefit from higher throughput, lower latency, and a larger range than they would with Wi-Fi. 

The network will take on various data-transmission applications, ranging from ordinary voice and video communications to remote control of lunar rovers, real-time navigation and streaming of high-definition video.  

While for now NASA is mostly thinking of using lunar 4G for experiments such as remote driving a rover to more distant locations than would be possible with Wi-Fi, Klein does not shy of thinking big. ""In the future, as we establish a longer-term presence on the moon and build more communities, and perhaps in the future on Mars, there will be more needs for voice communication,"" he says. 

In the near future, however, the focus remains on making the technology work reliably as part of a first, un-crewed mission planned for 2022, to test the readiness of the technology and validate some of the key applications before Nokia's 4G infrastructure can be used by actual astronauts at a future date. 

To transport 4G technology to the moon, Nokia is working with autonomous spacecraft company Intuitive Machines, which is building a lunar lander to carry the LTE communications system through space, and safely deliver the network equipment to the lunar surface. 

Nokia is fitting Intuitive Machine's lander with an LTE base station similar to those found in Earth-based 4G networks, which will self-configure upon deployment – but in this case, the station will be made into a compact single unit that integrates several network components, such as Evolved Packet Core (EPC) functionalities and RF antennas. 

The lander will then deploy a rover that will drive off with user equipment: ""The equivalent of a smartphone, but hardened for space conditions,"" says Klein – and an omni-directional antenna that will link back to the base station and effectively establish 4G connectivity.  

A satellite connection will then be used from the lander to communicate with mission control back on Earth, from where commands will be sent, and network equipment will be remotely managed. 

On the face of it, therefore, the process sounds straightforward and fairly similar to the deployment of a conventional network. That is only on the face of it, though: as Klein explains, the constraints of space mean that every detail has to be carefully planned for. 

First, there is launch and landing. ""The system has to be mechanically robust for launch and landing, to withstand shock, vibration, acceleration and all the mechanical stresses that come from just deploying it in space,"" says Klein. 

Even once the lander has successfully reached the lunar surface, he continues, the system must be ready for the extreme temperature variations of outer space, as well as terrain characteristics that are specific to the moon – ranging from different radio propagation to rock boulders, mountains and craters. 

There is also the question of size, weight and power, all of which have to be reduced to a minimum when venturing into space. ""You want reliability, and we have built redundancy in the system, but you have to balance this out with size, weight and power consumption,"" says Klein. ""A lot of work is going into integrating the system as much as possible to reduce all of those."" 

It goes without saying that the system is undergoing all sorts of rigorous testing. In test chambers, the equipment has been subjected to a series of 25 experiments involving different accelerations and vibrations, but also temperatures, radiation levels and even an operational vacuum. 

What's more, with a number of eerie, moon-like landscapes on offer even on planet Earth, Nokia has taken the system out in the open to gauge how well the technology performs on solid ground.

For example, in the Canaries archipelago in Spain, the island of Fuerteventura has a volcanic landscape with a similar setup to the moon. Klein and his team traveled to the spot and deployed the equipment, checking how the antennas performed at different heights and configurations, in a setting devoid of trees or buildings. 

But even more than ensuring that the hardware survives, explains Klein, it is the possibility of software glitches that keeps him up at night. In effect, if the system fails for any reason, sending a technician out to have a look won't exactly be an option. 

""We do remote maintenance on Earth, of course, but you always have the possibility to send somebody out,"" says Klein. ""Once this network is launched, we have to be able to absolutely operate this remotely."" 

To this effect, Klein is constantly tweaking and refining Nokia's operation and maintenance software suite, to let the team reboot, make configuration changes and manage the lunar network remotely – albeit with the knowledge that some setbacks are bound to happen, without any way of preparing for them in advance. 

""Ultimately, the only thing to do is fly and test it for real,"" says Klein. The timing is aggressive: Klein and his team were given two years between the moment Nokia was selected and the first targeted launch. That's not a whole lot of time to prepare to bring 4G/LTE to the moon; but for Klein, the project is on track to stick to the deadline. It looks like the next few years, therefore, will see even the Moon going through its very own digital transformation.

"American Airlines Passenger Won’t Stop Doing Pull-Ups, Forces Emergency Landing","There’s a time and a place to work on lat strength and a five-hour flight across the United States is not one of them. 

On Monday night, American Airlines flight 2763 was just trying to make the regular flight from Phoenix to Boston but according to the news we first saw covered by CBS Boston, an unnamed fitness enthusiast had other ideas. He wanted to work on his pull-ups. 

The man, who was said to be intoxicated if you can believe it, boarded the flight with a woman and not one, but two dogs — which is already pushing it, let’s be honest. He ordered more drinks during the flight and after another passenger inadvertently egged him on, the man started doing pull-ups off of the overhead compartment. 

Then he refused to stop. 

Passenger David Maroski gave a play-by-play of what happened. 

He was leaning up against where you put the bags overhead and a passenger came by and said ‘What are you going to do, some pull ups?’ and the guy actually grabbed on to it and started doing some pull ups on the plane in front of everybody. 

He would not sit down. The flight attendant probably asked him about three or four times to sit down and he refused to sit down and then he really got verbally abusive with her, starting calling her names. 

Verbal abuse is about when flight attendants decide to no longer tolerate your crap and the pilots decided to divert the plane to Kansas City. FBI agents greeted the man at the gate, but it appears that no one has been taken into custody or been charged. 

Amazingly, the plane eventually touched down at Boston at 1am, just 90 minutes after the original arrival time, which is pretty impressive given the impromptu landing and FBI involvement.

New Earth-sized planet found in habitable sweet-spot orbit around a distant star,"Researchers have discovered a new Earth-sized planet orbiting a star outside our solar system. The planet, called Kepler-1649c, is only around 1.06 times larger than Earth, making it very similar to our own planet in terms of physical dimensions. It’s also quite close to its star, orbiting at a distance that means it gets around 75% of the light we do from the Sun. 

The planet’s star is a red dwarf, which is more prone to the kind of flares that might make it difficult for life to have evolved on its rocky satellite’s surface, unlike here in our own neighborhood. It orbits so closely to its star, too, that one year is just 19.5 of our days — but the star puts out significantly less heat than the Sun, so that’s actually right in the proper region to allow for the presence of liquid water. 

Kepler-1649c was found by scientists digging into existing observations gathered by the Kepler space telescope before its retirement from operational status in 2018. An algorithm that was developed to go through the troves of data collected by the telescope and identify potential planets for further study failed to properly ID this one, but researchers noticed it when reviewing the information. 

There’s still a lot that remains to be discovered about the exoplanet, like what its atmosphere is like. There could be any number of other problems with Kepler-1649c relative to its ability to support life, as well, including errors in the data used to determine that it is Earth-like and in the correct habitable zone around its star. But this represents one of the best-ever potential extra-solar planets found in terms of its potential of supporting life, thanks to the combo of its size and the temperate orbital band it occupies. 

Identified exoplanets with Earth-like characteristics provide scientists with good candidates for future study, including targeting via Earth-based and in-space observation instruments. It’ll probably be a long time before we can definitively say anything about whether or not they might support actual life, but even finding exoplanets with the potential is an exciting development.

Reason Why Khatib and Yio Chu Kang MRT Station Are So Far Apart is Allegedly Due to Disneyland,"If you look at the MRT map, you’ll see that the distance between Khabit MRT Station and Yio Chu Kang MRT Station is, well, pretty reasonable. 

But take the train and you’ll know that it’s a bloody long ride between these stations. 

For the record, the travel time between these two stations is six minutes. The typical travel time (if that’s no breakdown lah) between two stations is about two to four minutes. 

This stretch of line is also scheduled for maintenance and improvement works this month during the weekends, leading to early closures and late openings. 

Now that the numbers and facts are out of the way, here’s the revelation that you might not know: there was actually an MRT station planned between them, and it was rumuored to be named Lentor MRT Station. 

We now know Lentor MRT Station as a real MRT station that’s part of the new Thomson-East Coast Line, in which Lentor MRT Station itself is scheduled to be operational by 2020 serving residents in Ang Mo Kio, located underneath Lentor Drive. 

But what about the previously rumoured Lentor MRT Station? 

Hold your breath, because you’re going to scream after that. 

Apparently, in the 1990s, Disney (yes, Disneyland!) proposed to build a theme park there. Lest you’re not aware, Disney owns the Marvel movies as well, so if there’s a Disneyland here, we could well be taking selfies with Iron Man and Captain America now. 

After talks and whatnot, the idea was abandoned after Disney and the Government could not come out with a feasible and workable theme park. 

And so, ta-da: we have, instead of Disneyland, a loooooooooong MRT ride. 

The Disneyland is supposed to be along Lentor Avenue, but well, at least we’ve got Universal Studios Singapore now lah. 

Just imagine this: tourists coming to Singapore merely because of Disneyland. And no longer do we need to go Hong Kong just to see Mickey Mouse in action. 

I don’t know about you, but Singapore would definitely be different if that had gone through, and people living in the north would have been, erm, happier?

"Yes, your phone is taking ‘invisible’ pictures of you","A video showing a mobile device snapping infrared images of an iPhone user is circulating around the internet and is catching many by surprise. 

In the Tik Tok shared by user Brie Thomason, a digital camera using an infrared lens is seen filming an iPhone user observing their home screen. As the iPhone user stares blatantly at the device, Thomason’s digital camera captures the iPhone snapping multiple infrared images every 5-10 seconds. 

Since the video was uploaded to social media on May 8, it has garnered over 224k likes and over 17.5k shares; alarming some and catching many off guard. 

While this discovery may cause some users to panic, Apple claims this is actually just an aspect of the iPhone that allows users to control their face ID and Animoji (the animated emoji function). 

According to Apple, this feature was first debuted as the iPhone X’s most groundbreaking function; since it is not even discernible at first glance, even though it literally stares you in the face. 

The company calls this feature: the new TrueDepth IR camera. This camera, housed in the black notch at the top of the display, includes a number of high-tech components such as a “flood illuminator,” infrared (IR) camera, and an infrared emitter. 

Officials say as an iPhone is used, the latter emits 30,000 infrared dots in a known pattern when a face is detected, enabling the iPhone X to generate a 3D map of a user’s face. According to the team, this TrueDepth IR camera can also do this fast enough to support the creation of 3D motion data as well.

Sunscreen Has Killed More People Than The Sun,"Such a great post I had to share from @carnivoreaurelius - hits the nail on the head!  

The sunscreen industry has grown to $2bn but melanoma rates continue to increase.  

Interesting huh? 

Sunscreen doesn’t “protect” you against the sun. It blocks UVB and it dumps toxins into your bloodstream. 

These toxic chemicals have been detected in the blood above acceptable FDA levels. 

It also prevents you from synthesizing vitamin D, a contributing factor to why sun deficiencies are linked to cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, depression, heart disease and diabetes. 

A study on outdoor workers showed that those who got the most sun exposure actually had the lowest melanoma risk. 

A huge reason for the increase in skin cancer is because of the toxic seed oils that are then incorporated into your cell membranes. 

On top of that your skin is actually able to produce endogenous “sunscreen” when it reacts with the infrared in the sun. 

Most of the studies on the dangers of the sun don’t account for this because they blast animals with isolated UV rays. 

Humans were made to enjoy the sun. 

I’m not saying go mad, still respect the sun & exposure, but also respect that toxic chemicals aren’t the solution… 

However, Astaxanthin is a favourite of mine for protecting us naturally from the inside out. I’ve done a full post about it a few months ago. Check it out to see why it works.

NEW YORK: CHINESE IMMIGRANT SOLD HOT DOGS MADE WITH REAL DOG MEAT,"Xi Ping Chow, a 57-year-old Chinese immigrant, has been arrested by the NYPD this week after authorities were informed that the man was making his own hotdogs with the meat of stray dogs in the area. 

NYC food inspectors were anonymously tipped on Chow’s operation which possibly involved recuperating dead dogs in dumpsters of the Animal Care Centers all over the city report officials. 

Sixteen other family members are also under investigation as they were currently volunteering in nine different Animal Care Centers in the New York City area and suburbs have confirmed authorities. 

Chow’s lawyer, Justin Wang, told reporters that he was currently not aware of any concrete evidence that his client, who has been charged with animal cruelty, had sold dog meat but that if he had, it was only a cultural misunderstanding, he argued. 

Chow’s wife, Hu-Wen Zhao, believes the owner of the hot dog stand on the other side of the street has conspired against her husband to shut down his business. 

Killing dogs and cats for meat is still legal in 44 U.S. states but in the state of New York it is expressly prohibited for “any person to slaughter or butcher  domesticated dogs or domesticated cats to create food, meat or meat products for human or animal consumption.”

Police Warn Yishun Residents of Harassment Letters Signed Off By Lord Voldermort,"Someone’s apparently been masquerading as the Dark Lord from the Harry Potter series by sending out harassment letters signed off by “Lord Voldermort”. (Although they could’ve at least spelled the name of He Who Must Not Be Named correctly.)

According to a police advisory, the threatening letters stamped with the word “URGENT” were delivered to residents of a particular housing block in Yishun, informing them of one of their neighbor’s failure to repay his/her debt. The recipients were told to make said debtor pay up, or their own flats would be harassed.

Several residents in multiple locations other than Yishun lodged police reports upon receiving the letters. The authorities advised them not to follow the instructions and to avoid sending an email reply to the address given.

According to Channel NewsAsia, a resident in Clementi received a similar letter warning the recipient that it was “not a spam or a prank”. “Lord Voldermort” went on to say that “I am writing this mail to you because you and your family is about to face disturbing events soon”, as one of their neighbors owed him a couple thousand dollars.

“Please help me to urge him to pay me what I am supposed to get or I will start harassing YOUR unit,” declared the letter, which came with an email address and a deadline. “I am sure you do not want your gate on fire or red paint all over your unit.” 

It went on to threaten the recipient with: “You might be thinking you are safe because you live in private property. I will not send this mail to you if I do not have ways to get to you and harass you.” 

Member of Parliament for Nee Soon, Lee Bee Wah, posted a photo of the advisory on Wednesday (Aug 31), telling residents to alert the police — who have been stepping up patrols in the area — of any suspicious behavior. 

Some residents have received letters that threaten to harass them. The letters are signed off by ""Lord Voldemort""!

Disconnect Grandpa to plug in the mobile charger,"UNPLUGGED THE RESPIRATOR ""JUST TO SEND A WHATSAPP SAYING GRANDPA IS OKAY""

Adrián Hinojo, 26, went yesterday to the Gregorio Marañón hospital in Madrid to visit his grandfather, who was admitted for pulmonary involvement. In the absence of the nursing team and other family members, the young man decided to unplug the old man's artificial respirator to charge his mobile phone.

“Let's see: it was at 1% battery, which can be described as a critical situation. In addition, my mother asked me to tell her how grandfather was as soon as he arrived at the hospital, so I had to send him a WhatsApp, ”Hinojo excuses himself.
Far from just sending a message to his mother, Adrián took the opportunity to photograph his grandfather and upload the snapshots to Instagram. Damn, I did it so they could see that she was fine. It's true that he was turning blue, but I thought it was because of the Valencia filter, ”he says, referring to the moment when the old man began to suffer from a lack of oxygen.

""People could also have warned me instead of liking it,"" he complains.

""It is very fragile. Time goes by and he can bear less and less activity. It is slowly fading away and you can't do anything. It gives a lot of anger "", explains Adrián referring to his terminal.

Fortunately, the old man was able to reach the command to notify the infirmary and the doctors arrived in time to help him. “They went crazy when they saw that the respirator was off. I asked them where the hell the plugs were in that room and they didn't answer. It seems very strong to me that there is only one plug. They are the fucking health cuts "", laments Hinojo.

After the incident, Adrián's family has been outraged. «I understand the anger and I share it. But you have to find solutions. Either we buy one of those external batteries for the mobile phone or we change it for a new one. We cannot be like this », the young man sentenced.

"Truck Carrying 20,000 Pounds of Ramen Noodles Crashes Into Lake","A truck carrying 20,000 pounds of ramen noodles crashed on Tuesday before toppling into an Arkansas lake, as pictures shared by authorities showed the vehicle on its side in the water.

In a Facebook post on Tuesday evening, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission shared two photos of the truck lying on its side in a shallow portion of Lake Conway, located at the intersection of Arkansas Highway 89 and Interstate 40 in Faulkner County, Arkansas.

The commission wrote that the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality was notified of the incident, while a HAZMAT crew was on the scene investigating the crash that occurred at around 3:00 p.m. local time.

""A wrecker is removing the truck from the lake, which appears to be uncontaminated by the accident,"" the commission wrote.

The crash caused a stir on the agency's Facebook page, with the pictures and statement of the incident so far amassing 723 comments and 1,100 shares.

KARK-TV reported that the Mayflower Police Department was leading the investigation into the crash. The commission confirmed that the driver and passenger in the truck were unhurt in the incident.

The authorities have not yet revealed what company the 20,000 pounds of noodles belonged to, or where the product was being transported to on Tuesday afternoon.

Tuesday's incident is not the first time that a truck carrying ramen noodles has crashed in the U.S., as in January 2015 the contents of a delivery truck were spilled across a highway after the driver of a tractor-trailer collided into a guard rail.

The driver of the truck, Larry Scholting, told ABC15 that he crashed into the guard rail in Nash County, North Carolina, after he fell asleep at the wheel during his delivery.

""I thought I could make it down to the truck stops in Kenly, and I didn't quite make it. I kind of drowsed off, and next thing I knew I had taken out the guard rail,"" Scholting said.

Although Scholting was not injured in the crash, dozens of packets of the noodles were thrown from the truck during the incident when the trailer's cargo space was cut in half.

Part of the road was closed as the authorities cleaned up the mess, while the noodles were dumped at a local landfill after becoming contaminated by diesel fuel that leaked during the crash.

The Fascinating Reason Why There Are No Mosquitoes at Disney World,"There are no mosquitoes in The Most Magical Place on Earth. That's right, Disney World is so dedicated to making sure you have the time of your life that they've made the bugs practically disappear. How do they pull that off? No, the answer isn't magic. Vlogger Rob Plays delved into the answer in a video spotted by Neatorama.

It would be a feat to get rid of pesky mosquitoes anywhere, but Disney World is in Florida, a.k.a. swamp territory, where insects are more abundant than other places. Bugs are annoying, but they're also dangerous if they're carrying diseases like Zika, and Disney has a responsibility to protect its guests. In short, Disney gets rid of the pests by employing a comprehensive program that includes spraying insecticides and maintaining natural predators, and they do all of this with a level of vigilance that's fearsome to behold.

The park has something called the Mosquito Surveillance Program to manage it all. There are carbon dioxide traps everywhere, and once they catch bugs, the team at Disney freezes and analyzes the population to determine how best to eradicate them. Interestingly enough, they also employ the use of chickens. These sentinel chickens, as they're called, live in coops all over Disney World. While these feathered employees are going about their daily life, their blood is being monitored for mosquito-borne diseases like West Nile virus. Lucky for the chickens, they don't get sick from the virus—but if they do pick it up, the Disney team knows where in the park they got it from so they can deliver a swift blow to the mosquitoes in that area.

You may also notice that the video is populated by clips of the Seven Dwarfs spraying insecticides. If you're wondering how you missed a lengthy sequence in which Happy, Grumpy, and co. did battle with the local insect population in 1937's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, you didn't. The clips come from a separate propaganda film that Disney made during World War II called The Winged Scourge, all about the dangers of malaria and the insects that carry it. The disease caused major casualties for the Allies while fighting in the Pacific Ocean theater of World War II.

Next time you're visiting Disney World, be sure to appreciate the relatively insect-free utopia before returning to the real world.",hard,https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/548281/reason-why-there-are-no-mosquitoes-in-disney-world,TRUE,"This is fake news.

Starbucks faces drinks ingredients shortage in US,"Starbucks has been hit by supply shortages in the US meaning some drinks are unavailable for customers.

The coffee chain said it was seeing ""temporary supply shortages"" for items such as oat milk.

A Starbucks spokeswoman said: ""Specific items will vary by market and store, and some stores will experience outages of various items at the same time.

She apologised for any ""inconvenience"" faced by customers and said it was working with vendors to restock items.

Starbucks customers in the US who open the firm's app are also currently greeted with a message apologising for any shortages.

Other than oat milk, Starbucks would not confirm which other ingredients were affected.

But an internal memo, seen by Business Insider, suggests that 25 different products are on a ""temporary hold"" including hazelnut syrup, chai tea bags and green iced tea.

Caffeine addicts on social media have also been complaining about not being able to order their favourite drinks.

Others said they had noticed that no caramel flavouring or lemonade was available in their local outlets.

Some members of staff also posted about the frustration of having to explain the situation to customers.

One wrote that the firm had not anticipated such a significant number of customers returning to cafes and restaurants as coronavirus restrictions ease.

The BBC asked Starbucks for specific details about why there were shortages.

The company said in an emailed reply: ""The temporary supply shortages occurring in the US on some products is attributable to the supply chain constraints.""

Earlier this week, it announced that customers in the US would be allowed to start using reusable cups again to get a discount on their drinks in company-owned cafes.

The Seattle-based firm is among a number of companies in the US facing supply chain issues and a shortage of workers in recent weeks.

AirPods!?🥴,"Did you know even non-ionising radiation drastically effects your health over long sustained periods? Independent studies have been done to confirm this - check out bioinitiative.org for more info on that.

The issue with AirPods is that they literally sit inside your skull, they are so close to your brains it's unbelievable. One health issue caused by over exposure to low frequency EMF is the opening of the blood-brain barrier, which opens the gateway to allow heavy metals and toxic overloads to enter the brain. That's atrocious.

From my previous research, AirPods contain a H1 chip, which allows synch pairing between each earphone. If this is true, your brain is literally being cooked. Thousands of people have thrown them away after experiencing massive headaches and other symptoms from using them.

I don't personally use bluetooth headphones, i'm old school. I like the wires, but most the time i use speakerphone if i'm on a call. It's time we start protecting ourselves.

It snowed in one of the hottest places in the world,"(CNN) - It's quite a time for the weird weather, and it doesn't get much weirder than snow falling in one of the hottest places in the world. 

On Sunday, Ain Sefra, a desert town in Algebria known as the ""Gateway to the Sahara"", experienced a substantial amoun of snow for reportedly the third time in 40 years. Some reports say parts of the area got nearly 15 inches of snow, but Ain Sefra officially reported less than one inch. 

It was enough to provide some otherworldly visuals from an area that routinely sees some of the hottest temperature on earth during the summer. 

Now, it's not uncommon for the temperature across even the hottest of deserts to plunge tens of degrees Farenheit at night, meaning any unusual snow could stick around for a while. But photographers at the scene said the snow actually stayed intact for a good portion of the day.

""We were really surprised when we woke up to see snow again,"" photographer Karim Bouchetata told Shutterstock. ""It stayed all day on Sunday and began melting at around 5p.m.""

While snow is historically scant in the desert area, a similar snow phenomenon happened just last year.

Argan: The tree that attracts goats,"We often see goats rambling on the grassland, but you might see a very unusual sight when traveling around Morocco: goats eating on the trees!

The special tree that goats like to climb is the Argan tree (Argania spinosa), a plant that is endemic to the arid and semi-arid regions of southwestern Morocco. The tree produces small flowers with five yellow petals. Its fruit has thick peel, sweet-smelling pulp that attracts the goats, and a hard nut that contains oil-rich seeds.

The sight of goats perching on the trees is so unique that it attracts numbers of tourists to take pictures. However, since the fruit takes about a year to mature, and ripen in June to July, it means people can only have an authentic spotting during these months.

But out of the drive for profit, many local farmers put the goats on the trees intentionally during tourist season even when there are no fruits on the trees, so they can charge for taking pictures. Such behaviors not only cause goats to suffer from scorching days standing in the sun, but also damage the trees that are already evaluated as Vulnerable by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

Besides, the oil extracted from the seeds of Argan tree is rich in essential fatty acid. It's used in cooking and cosmetics, as well as a treatment for skin diseases. The high demand for its nut earns the plant another name: Morocco's ""desert gold.""",hard,https://news.cgtn.com/news/2019-09-08/Argan-The-tree-that-attracts-goats-JOE29Xj6I8/index.html,FALSE,This is real news.

533 million Facebook users' phone numbers and personal data have been leaked online.,"A user in a low-level hacking forum on Saturday published the phone numbers and personal data of hundreds of millions of Facbook users for free. 

The exposed data includes the personal information of over 533 million Facebook users from 106 countries, including over 32 million records on users in the US, 11 million on users in the UK, and 6 million on users in India. It includes their phone numbers, Facebook IDs, full names, locations, birthdates, bios, and, in some cases, email addresses.

Insider reviewed a sample of the backend data and verified several records by matching known Facebook users' phone numbers with the IDs listed in the data set. We also verified records by testing email addresses from the data set in Facebook's password-reset feature, which can be used to partially reveal a user's phone number.

A Facebook spokesperson told Insider that the data had been scraped because of a vulnerability that the company patched in 2019.

While it's a couple of years old, the leaked data could prove valuable to cybercriminals who use people's personal information to impersonate them or scam them into handing over login credentials, according to Alon Gal the chief technology officer of the cybercrime intelligence firm Hudson Rock, who discovered the trough of leaked data on Saturday.

""A database of that size containing the private information such as phone numbers of a lot of Facebook's users would certainly lead to bad actors taking advantage of the data to perform social-engineering attacks [or] hacking attempts,"" Gal told Insider.

Gal discovered the leaked data in January when a user in the same hacking forum advertised an automated bot that could provide phone numbers for hundreds of millions of Facebook users for a price. Motherboard reported on that bot's existence at the time and verified that the data was legitimate. 

Now the data set has been posted on the hacking forum for free, maing it available to anyone with redimentary data skills.

Insider attempted to reach the leaker through the messaging app Telegram but did not get a response. 

This is not the first time that lots of Facebook users' phone numbers have been found exposed online. The vulnerability uncovered in 2019 allowed millions of phone numbers to be scraped from Facebook's servers in violation of its terms of service. Facebook said that vulnerability was patched in August 2019.

Facebook vowed to crack down on mass data-scraping after Cambridge Analytica scraped the data of over 80 million users in violation of Facebook's terms of service to target voters with political ads in the 2016 election. 

Gal said that from a security standpoint there wasn't much Facebook could do to help users affected by the breach since their data is already out in the open, but he added that Facebook could notify users so they could remain vigilant about phishing schemes or fraud using their data.

""Individuals signing up to a reputabl company like Facebook are trusting them with their data, and Facebook [is] supposed to treat the data with utmost respect,"" Gal said.

"Data shows fully vaccinated individuals in UK, NZ are developing AIDS","Data recently released by the New Zealand government showed fully vaccinated individuals developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or AIDS, showing major degradation of the immune system. Just like other governments before, the New Zealand Ministry of Health only provides a cumulative total of Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) cases from August 16, 2021, showing misleading numbers considering that the nation is currently experiencing its biggest outbreak to date. However, this is not the only problem when it comes to New Zealand's reporting. On August 16, 2021, the date the Health Ministry has chosen to provide a cumulative total, only 18.4 percent of the population was considered fully vaccinated. Infections have been increasing, with 20,632 new infections reported on average every day. This is around 99 percent of the peak average reported on March 7. New Zealand has administered at least 10,757,940 doses of the vaccines so far. Assuming every person needs two doses, that number is enough for 109.4 percent of the country’s population. However, only 78 percent are considered fully vaccinated. The data presented by the government showed that the real-world two-dose COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness between January 6 to February 11,  proved to be in the negative at -94.4 percent. However, between February 12 to 24, the numbers declined further, with effectiveness estimated to have fallen to -281.35 percent. This means the fully vaccinated are 3.8 times more likely to be infected with COVID-19 than the unvaccinated or single-dose population. Much of the data that is being released also showed that the shots are slowly giving the population AIDS, which is a complete degradation of the immune system. When this happens, even the slightest cold could be detrimental to their health, as their immune systems will be too weak to fight off the virus. (Related: Dr. Zev Zelenko: Anyone with immune deficiency can die from a cold.)
UK data shows similar evidence.

The U.K. government also recently released more documentation that showed strong evidence of the COVID-19 vaccine causing AIDS. According to compiled data, vaccine immunity is not supposed to wane. The human immune system, however, can get damaged or degraded. Vaccine effectiveness, as it turns out, is not the measure of a vaccine per se, but a measure of its effectiveness in terms of the recipient's immune system performance compared to the immune system performance of an unvaccinated person. The first time the body encounters a germ, it can take several days to make and use all the germ-fighting tools needed to get over the infection. After, the immune system remembers what it learned about how to protect the body against the disease. Vaccines, on the other hand, help develop immunity by imitating an infection. Once the imitation goes away, the body is left with a supply of ""memory"" t-cells and antibodies that will remember how to fight the disease in the future. So when authorities say that vaccine effectiveness weakens over time, they really mean that the immune system is the one that is weakening. In taking the case rates found in previous reports, tracking the real-world vaccine effectiveness and immune system performance is easy based on previously published data. Based on the information given, the 40 to 49-year-old age range had the worst immune system performance, which was recorded at -60 percent by January 2. It declined further to -67.7 percent by January 30. With the information given, it can be gauged that COVID-19 death rates per 100,000, by vaccination status in England, calculated from the number of deaths found and the size of the double-vaccinated population, it seems that the double vaccinated population has the highest death rate per 100,000 in every age group except for the 18 to 29 and 40 to 49-year-olds. However, it is expected that the rate could switch up in the coming weeks.",medium,https://citizens.news/600779.html,TRUE,This is fake news.

The FBI's 83-page guide to internet slang is an absolute rollercoaster,"For about as long as the internet has existed, it’s been used for illicit activity. Before e-commerce ballooned into a multi-trillion dollar industry, the first deal facilitated by the internet was a weed exchange between students at Stanford University and MIT at some point between 1971 and 1972. These days, McAffee estimates cybercrime costs the global economy as much as $600 billion, and the FBI’s efforts to curb the harm of internet fraud have taken many forms over the years.

The agency even compiled an internal 83-page guide to internet slang which, thanks to a 2014 Freedom of Information Act request, is now available for your enjoyment. It’s on the Internet Archive, albeit in very low quality, and it has 2,800 entries from ALIHAL (at least I have a life) to WWOTW (wicked witch of the west) and everywhere in between.

It’s unclear whether anyone is conducting illicit online activities that require the acronym “WYLASOMWTC” (Would you like a saucer of milk with that comment?) but if they are, the FBI will be onto you!

A number of slang terms were new to me:

IOKIYAR = it’s ok if you’re a Republican
BFP = big fat positive (i.e. pregnant)
BIC = believe it comrade
FTASB = faster than a speeding bullet
DPYN = don’t pick your nose
EB = eyeball
IITYWTMWYKM = if I tell you what this means will you kiss me
A new personal favorite is H9, which the esteemed Federal Bureau of Investigations defines as “really hate (H8 + 1) and the various numerical ways to say “I love you”: either 381 (3 words, 8 letters, 1 meaning) or 143 (one letter, four letters, 3 letters).

HOW DO YOU DO, FELLOW KIDS? — Baffled adults must decrypt the messages their kids send online, from the everyday ROFL to the more unusual acronym DITYID (“Did I tell you I’m depressed?”). And hey, the FBI is no different! Even the foremost U.S. intelligence agency needs a Twitter lingo cheat sheet, which its employees “should find useful in [their] work or for keeping up with [their] children and/or grandchildren.”

Good faith guides to internet lingo are so widespread that they’ve become a meme. Is your child texting about Charles Dickens? Herpetology? What about Coronavirus? Even the brands are mocking clueless adults.",medium,https://www.inputmag.com/culture/fbi-guide-to-internet-slang,FALSE,"This is real news. While this story is not new, and was first reported in 2014, it is true that when the internet and Twitter became much more prominent, the FBI created this list of internet shorthand to help their agents understand internet lingo.

PETA Urges Phish To Become Sea Kittens,"BURLINGTON, Vt. —
If there is anything sacred in Vermont's music scene, the Green Mountain-grown jam rock band Phish tops the list, but apparently even they can't avoid the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals' seemingly endless public scrutiny.

On Friday, PETA Special Projects Manager Michelle Cho issued a letter to area media outlets outlining a request that the band temporarily change its name to the ""Sea Kittens.""

The letter, addressed to Trey Anastasio, Jon Fishman, Mike Gordon and Page McConnell, says the request is an attempt to gain empathy for fish, ""because few people are aware that fish are actually smart animals with personalities.""

""For example, they communicate and develop relationships with one another, feel pain when injured (their lips are particularly sensitive, and they use them like we use our fingers), show affection by gently rubbing against other fish, and even grieve when other fish they like die,"" the letter continues.

Cho's letter urges people to take on activities such as hiking, instead of ""impaling fish with metal hooks for fun"" and claims that fish endure a brutal death by fishermen. ""Phish has a long history of promoting social justice. Renaming the band Sea Kittens would be a great way to help sea kittens rock on, free from fishing nets and hooks, even if just for a day,"" the letter says.

WPTZ.com tried to contact the band, but a message left with their Burlington office was not returned. The band got back together earlier this year and launched an extensive tour.

PETA's latest foray into the world of public discourse comes after several regional protests that included a woman appearing virtually nude on Church Street in Burlington, asking Ben & Jerry's to use human breast milk in their ice cream, and contending that people who eat meat should pay more for life insurance.",hard,https://www.mynbc5.com/article/peta-urges-phish-to-become-sea-kittens/3290602,FALSE,"This is real news. PETA is notorious for bombastic and attention-grabbing campaigns, and one of such campaign is to rename fishes as sea kittens.
